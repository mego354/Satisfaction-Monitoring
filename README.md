# Satisfaction Monitoring System Enhancement – Heart Rate & SpO2 Integration

This project is an enhancement to a graduation project initially built with Flask and MongoDB to monitor user satisfaction through facial expressions and hand gestures.

## 👨‍💻 My Contribution (Freelance)

I was tasked with integrating biometric data — specifically **heart rate and SpO2** — to improve the accuracy of satisfaction detection.

## 🔧 What I Did

- Built a custom hardware module using:
  - **MAX30102 Pulse Oximeter Sensor**
  - **ESP8266/ESP32 Microcontroller**
  - **Handmade PCB**
- Collected averaged heart rate and SpO2 data in real-time.
- Sent data via **HTTP POST requests** to the existing Flask backend.
- Synced biometric data with computer vision analysis for real-time feedback.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Flask (Python)
- MongoDB
- ESP8266 / ESP32
- MAX30102 Sensor
- Arduino IDE
- Custom PCB design
- HTTP APIs

## 📷 Future Improvements

- Visual dashboard for biometric trends
- Secure transmission of health data
- Multi-user session handling
